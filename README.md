# ib-traffic-monitor

## Intro

`ib-traffic-monitor` is a tool to monitor the local InfiniBand device metrics under Linux operating system. It is written in C and utilizing [ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/) as the TUI library.

## Metrics List

`ib-traffic-monitor` reports following metrics

| Interface I/O | MC RX Packet | packet/second | number of received multicast packets |
| Interface I/O | MC TX Packet | packet/second | number of transmitted multicast packets |
| Interface Error | Symbol | count | number of minor link errors detected on one or more physical lanes |

```

## Usage

Users can simply run `ib-traffic-monitor` without any options. The default refresh period is 5 seconds.

If `ib-traffic-monitor` cannot not detect any valid InfiniBand device, the program will exit with error.

```
$ ./ib-traffic-monitor -h
InfiniBand Traffic Monitor - Version 1.4.1
usage: ib-traffic-monitor [-r|--refresh <second(s)>]
                          [-e|--ethernet]
                          [-m|--memory-lock]
                          [-h|--help]
```

`-r` or `--refresh`: specify the refresh period. the unit is second

`-e` or `--ethernet`: show Ethernet link layer type devices. the default behavior is showing InfiniBand link layer devices only

`-m` or `--memory-lock`: enable memory lock on application

`-h` or `--help`: show help message

## Debian Package

`packaging/build-deb.sh` builds a `.deb` containing the binary, the systemd service and its defaults file. It needs `dpkg-deb`, `make` and a compiler, and writes the package into `dist/` unless another output directory is given. The version of the package is the `VERSION` define of the program.

```
$ ./packaging/build-deb.sh
building ib-traffic-monitor 1.4.1 for arm64
...
dependencies: libc6 (>= 2.34), libncurses6 (>= 6), libtinfo6 (>= 6)
dpkg-deb: building package 'ib-traffic-monitor' in 'dist/ib-traffic-monitor_1.4.1_arm64.deb'.

package: dist/ib-traffic-monitor_1.4.1_arm64.deb
install: sudo apt install dist/ib-traffic-monitor_1.4.1_arm64.deb
```

The package is built with `make release`, which uses the same warning set as the development build but drops the undefined behavior sanitizer and turns on optimization and the usual hardening flags. The `MAINTAINER` and `ARCH` environment variables override the maintainer field and the target architecture.

Package contents:

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/usr/bin/ib-traffic-monitor` | the program |
| `/lib/systemd/system/ib-traffic-monitor.service` | systemd service running the headless exporter |
| `/etc/default/ib-traffic-monitor` | arguments passed to the program, a conffile |

## Systemd Service

Installing the package enables and starts `ib-traffic-monitor.service`, which runs the program headless with `--daemon`, serving the metrics over HTTP for Prometheus instead of drawing the TUI. On a host with no matching device the program exits and systemd retries every 5 seconds, so add `--ethernet` to the arguments when the ports to monitor are RoCE ports.

```
$ sudo systemctl status ib-traffic-monitor
$ sudo journalctl -u ib-traffic-monitor -f
$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:19315/metrics
```

The arguments come from `/etc/default/ib-traffic-monitor`, `--daemon` is always added by the unit:

```
IB_TRAFFIC_MONITOR_ARGS="--listen 0.0.0.0 --port 19315"
```

```
$ sudo editor /etc/default/ib-traffic-monitor
$ sudo systemctl restart ib-traffic-monitor
```

The service reads only world-readable files under `/sys/class/infiniband`, so it runs as a `DynamicUser` with no capabilities and the usual systemd sandboxing (`ProtectSystem=strict`, `PrivateDevices=yes`, `SystemCallFilter=@system-service`, and more). Binding a port below 1024 or using `--memory-lock` is therefore not possible without relaxing the unit.

## Use Case

* Demos from [GNA-G Community](https://www.gna-g.net/) in SC25:

[Demo](https://sc25.supercomputing.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/nre128s3.pdf)

[Presentation](https://www.gna-g.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/rednesp_sc25_widescreen-v1.6.pdf)

```
The demonstration successfully featured the simultaneous transfer of data from multiple Brazilian universities to the exhibition hall at SC25.

The ib-traffic-monitor tool was essential, enabling both the initial equipment setup and the continuous monitoring of the production links used throughout the demo.
